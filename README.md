rename-JPG-to-Date
==================

Simple program to rename jpg files to EXIF shotdate or last modified datetime

The jar file runs well on Ubuntu 12.04 and win7, which can rename jpg and jpeg files to their shottime (based on the exif info) or their last modifid time (rename to last modified time is optional).

The folder is the eclipse java project code of the jar file. You may need to modify the metadata-extractor lib path before you modify the other code.
